# Search Form

**Search Form** is a Python project built on the **FastAPI** framework. Its main functionality is to dynamically generate unlimited Pydantic models from JSON input, validate incoming data, and output either the matching model name or the data type if no match is found.  

## Supported Data Types

1. **`str`** - Regular Python string.  
2. **`email`** - Pydantic's standard `EmailStr` class for email validation.  
3. **`phone`** - A custom Pydantic class `PhoneNumber`, recognizing phone numbers in formats:  
   - `+7 xxx xxx xx xx`  
   - `8 xxx xxx xx xx`  
4. **`date`** - A custom Pydantic class `Date`, validating dates in the formats:  
   - `"%d.%m.%Y"`  
   - `"%Y-%m-%d"`
